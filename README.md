# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

##Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to use R(programming language) in statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze data from the auto industry.


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Linear Regression](https://github.com/amburu4159/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/Linear%20Regression%20to%20Predict%20MPG.PNG)

•	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
	o	Vehicle weight and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the linear model of the data set

•	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? 
	o	The slope is not considered zero because of the p-value, which is less than 0.05.

•	Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? 
	o	Yes, it does. R-square is 71%. So, the variations in mpg can be explained by changes in the vehicle length, the vehicle weight, the spoiler angle, the drivetrain and the ground clearance with a 71% certainty, which is effective
